# Mini-Project 11: Machine Learning Basic Algorithms From Scratch




## Summary
Algorithms list:

1. k-means;
2. Gradient Descending Algorithm 
## Introduction

## Method
1. k means algorithm;
2. Gradient Descending Algorithm 




## Results and Discussion

Confusion matrix (left); Centroids pathways while updating (right). {\color{red} $\star$} refers initial points of k means; 'x' refers wrong prediction.

* Gradient Descending Algorithm and it's performance while discovering iris pedal width and length

Learning rate: $0.0001$ and $eps=0.01$

## Reproducibility

### Dependencies
I test these codes on linux systerm (Ubuntu 22.04). I tried to make these codes only depend on numpy. These are basic python libararies, thus it should work if you computer can use python3.

* python3;
* python libraries: numpy.
### Usage


## Conclusion

Deliverables:
* **k means algorithm**: k-means algorithm is an perfect example to excersice EM, so I wrote k means from scatch;
